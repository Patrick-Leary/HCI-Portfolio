                                Design is a powerful tool that frames how users interact with the world around them. During my semester in human computer interaction, I learned key aspects of the design process while working on four major design sprints: Design for Dimensions, Design for Understanding, Design for Another World, and Redesign and Extend. We redesigned the website for Knotty & Board, a local furniture and decor retailer, for three screen sizes in the first design sprint. In the second sprint, we created both analytical and persuasive data visualizations. Next, we created a web-based video game in virtual reality. Finally, we redesigned our data visualizations into physical forms. Through these projects and individual homework assignments, I honed my skills in design and discovered crucial steps for creating a user-centered design. First, accessibility is paramount when creating a design. If the intended users are not able to use a product, then there is no point in making it. When attempting to make a design accessible, it is necessary to conduct user interviews. These interviews must be with people who will use the product but also span a wide range of users to learn a diverse set of needs. During the design process, it is crucial to iteratively design. This could be in the form of creating several sketches or receiving feedback from peers. This process allows for continuous refinement at every stage. Information must be discoverable through clear, consistent signifiers. If users cannot find the information, it might as well not be there. Lastly, data visualization is a very powerful tool in design. These visualizations can transform large datasets into digestible information. These principles allow designers to create impactful solutions while catering to their target audience.

                                When prototyping, including accessibility during the design process is paramount. While redesigning Knotty & Board's website, we immediately found accessibility issues. There were cases of white text on light-colored backgrounds and text that flowed off the page, making paragraphs unintelligible. When creating our new design, we kept accessibility at the forefront. We used the WebAIM checker to validate our color choices and to ensure that font sizes were legible. While creating data visualizations in our second design sprint, we implemented a sequential color scheme and used prominent text to increase readability. For our virtual reality project, we designed a gaze-based interaction system that allowed users to interact with objects simply by looking at them, removing the need for button presses. Additionally, we included audio feedback to clarify certain interactions. For our physical redesign project, we implemented further accessibility features, such as simplifying the color palette and using tactile elements like puffy paint. These accessibility features not only make the designs easier to understand but are essential for creating an effective product.

                            <h3>Interviews</h3>
                            <p class="py-1" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">
                                To make a design accessible, you must understand your audience. Interviews are an excellent way to identify the needs of target users and understand different perspectives on a given topic. When creating our persuasive visualization for the second design sprint, we gathered users' opinions on different visualizations to determine which one was the most persuasive. These interviews allowed us to create a more impactful design and saved us time later in the process, as we did not have to make large-scale changes after we started coding. While turning these visualizations into physical prototypes, we interviewed several people to find any issues with the original design. Then, we showed them our sketches for a physical version and received feedback on those as well. This information was essential, as creating physical prototypes is very time-consuming, so we needed to have definite designs before creating them. Finally, in one of my individual homework assignments, I worked on designing an app to track diabetes-related metrics. While it is important to get a wide range of perspectives from interviews, I only interviewed people with diabetes. This is because the target users for the app are people with diabetes, so it would not make sense to gather opinions from people who never use the product. Interviews help us identify the needs of target users, receive feedback on our designs, and decrease the amount of time spent prototyping in later stages.

                                It is important to continuously improve a product during the design process. The projects I worked on this semester emphasize the importance of constantly refining designs throughout this process. When reworking Knotty & Board's website, we created dozens of sketches before working in Figma. This approach improved the quality of our final product and decreased the time spent in Figma, which is more time-consuming than creating sketches. For the second design sprint, we also used sketches to iteratively improve our visualizations and receive feedback on our designs to determine the best solutions. Additionally, we used GitHub to manage version control of our webpage, which allowed us to revert changes and improve the design process. In our virtual reality project, we conducted playtests to identify possible problems with our game. This allowed us to detect bugs faster and improve the game as we worked. In the redesign and extend project, we tested our own physical prototypes to determine their usability. We found that there was too much friction on the wooden board for our analytical physicalization, so we added tape to the sides and bottom to reduce friction and increase ease of use. Continuously improving designs is crucial for creating intuitive and user-friendly products.

                                Effective signifiers bridge the gap between users' mental models and the system's functionality. Implementing clear and consistent signifiers throughout designs improves user experience and decreases cognitive load. While creating our data visualizations, we did not properly incorporate signifiers into our design. When viewing the map of the United States, users are able to click on individual states to see more information, but there is no signifier of this interaction, so users do not engage with it. Additionally, in the persuasive line graph, users can hover over individual points to see more data, but again, there is nothing that signifies this interaction. I attempted to learn from these mistakes in the virtual reality game. When selecting a button, there is both an audio cue and the cursor shrinks until the button is selected. However, many users did not know that they had to look at the button to select it. Users eventually discovered this interaction but only through trial and error. To improve the design, I could have included instructions on the first playthrough so that users understood that the control system was gaze-based. These projects demonstrated that without clear signifiers, users cannot fully utilize a design.

                                Data visualization can make large datasets understandable and persuasive. While users can interpret visualizations differently, designers hold immense power when creating visualizations to tell different stories. When displaying our analytical and persuasive visualizations about United States wildfires, some users thought that the analytical visualizations were persuasive. The visualization allowed users to see the number of wildfires caused by lightning strikes over time, which had the persuasive effect of showing users that these fires were becoming more extreme over time. Even without explicitly telling users anything, they were able to form a persuasive narrative in their minds. This effect was amplified when we showed them persuasive visualizations, further convincing them of a certain narrative. Humans naturally seek patterns, so users will typically notice when visualizations suggest certain correlations. This is crucial to keep in mind when creating neutral visualizations; give the user as much information as possible so that they are able to draw their own conclusions.

                                The principles discussed are crucial for making successful designs. When developing a product, interviews and iterative design improve its quality and accessibility, while including clear signifiers enables users to utilize the entire range of features. Each design sprint taught me valuable lessons. Design for Dimensions emphasized the importance of sketching before prototyping. Design for Understanding demonstrated how data visualization is key to portraying narratives, allowing users to create their own stories. Design for Another World revealed that even with signifiers, some interactions may remain unclear, especially in unfamiliar environments like virtual reality. Redesign and Extend showcased various ways to enhance accessibility, featuring physicalizations as a great method to visualize data and reach a wider audience. Human computer interaction has not only improved my design skills but also taught me the ethics of designing for a diverse range of users. These principles will guide me throughout my educational and professional career, helping me become both a better designer and more empathetic human being.
